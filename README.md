# learning-php

1st, go to https://www.mamp.info/en/
and download mamp free version

then start up your server and visit 
http://localhost:8888/introducingphp/config.php

clone this repo and move so that the path is like: 

/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/introducingphp

that should be it, you can always contact me if this is misleading

recommended text editors for learning would be dreamweaver in adobe's collection, personally I like using that for php while generally I use sublime 2(even though its kind of old) cheers!

in this repo the basics are discussed then the basic form is built
